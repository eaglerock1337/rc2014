# Documentation Sources

I have compiled together my own documentation, as well as outside documentation that I found useful. Any outside documenation I have received here:

## `rc2014/docs/scm`

This is the documentation for Small Computer Monitor by the author. Their website is located here:

`https://smallcomputercentral.wordpress.com/`

You can visit the specific link I found these docs here:

`https://smallcomputercentral.wordpress.com/small-computer-monitor/small-computer-monitor-v1-0/`

## `bdsoft bds c`

The official BDS site is located here:

`https://www.bdsoft.com/resources/bdsc.html`

From there, you can get the documentation and the now open domain code.
